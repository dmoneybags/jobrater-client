Put server side stuff back lol everything that needs a token can totally be client side

7/2/24:

Put appropriate things server-side:
    a lot of the code that should be server side isn't, db calls, auth stuff, glassdoor dispatcher,
    Their logic will have to be routed through the app listener in background js. Shouldn't be too
    hard. 
Finish User code:
    last function written was the google auth code:
        NOTE: we still need to activate this on our google dashboard
        NOTE: we still need to add functionality for sendMessageToAddUser
        NOTE: we still only have a placeholder url in our google auth code
    we are simply going top down
